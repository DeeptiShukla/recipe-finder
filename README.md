This is a Rails application whose goal is to provide web page access to recipe information served by https://www.food2fork.com/about/api through JSON and images.

This will display a recipe page based on a search keyword entered by the user.
1. The user will supply a keyword to search for (For example, append ?search=cake to the url).
2. The app will pass that query to http://food2fork.com/api and get the results.
3. The app will then build a web page display of the results and this page displayed will provide links to more detailed recipe information.
